# 🎮 ChainForge: Cross-Chain Gaming Identity & Asset Vault

> A decentralized, cross-chain identity and asset vault for gamers built on Polkadot using PolkaVM, AssetHub, and XCM.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**ChainForge** solves one of the biggest problems in Web3 gaming: fragmented gamer identities and scattered in-game assets across multiple blockchains.

We’ve built a unified solution — a **portable gamer identity** and **cross-chain asset vault** that works seamlessly across games and blockchains using the Polkadot ecosystem.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🧑‍🚀 **On-Chain Gamer Profile**  
  Create a tamper-proof gamer identity with achievements, stats, and verified credentials.

- 🧳 **Cross-Chain Asset Vault**  
  Securely deposit, manage, and transfer gaming NFTs and tokens across chains via AssetHub and XCM.

- 🛡 **Permissioned Access Control**  
  Use PolkaVM smart contracts to control which games/platforms can access or use specific assets.

- 🧠 **Decentralized & Modular**  
  Composable ink! contracts on PolkaVM enable game developers to integrate identity or vault logic easily.

- 👥 **Team & Clan Support** *(in development)*  
  Shared vaults, team achievements, and group permissions for collaborative gameplay.

- 🛒 **Marketplace Ready**  
  Plug into NFT marketplaces for gamers to trade directly from their ChainForge vault.

## 🧪 Local Development

### Smart Contract

#### Build
```bash
cd contracts/gamer_profile_contract
cargo +nightly contract build
```

#### Test
```bash
cd contracts/gamer_profile_contract
cargo +nightly contract test
```
_(Note: Tests might time out in some environments due to long compilation times.)_

### Frontend

#### Setup
```bash
cd web
npm install
```
_(Note: `npm install` might time out in some environments due to network or resource limitations.)_

#### Run
```bash
cd web
npm run start
```

This will start a development server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Features
- Connect to Polkadot{.js} extension.
- Select an account.
- Create a gamer profile (mocked interaction with the smart contract).
  - Input a handle.
  - Displays the created profile (handle and level 1).
- Get a gamer profile (mocked interaction).
  - Displays a fetched profile.
